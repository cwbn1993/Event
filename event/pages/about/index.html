            <h2 class="font-xl">Workshops</h2><br />
            <p>We will be hosting cooking workshops. The main aim of the vegan workshops is to cook vegan food as a group. Participants will learn new cuisine ideas and share their ideas with one another. Exploring cuisine of the regions, where the majority of recipes are originally vegan, or learning how to make home-made spreads and milks will widen the knowledge of the participants, which might turn out to be helpful in their everyday lives.</p>

            <h2 class="font-xl">Sound Baths</h2><br />
            <p>These will be held out in the middle of the park.<br> A Sound Bath is a deeply-immersive, full-body listening experience that intentionally uses sound to invite gentle yet powerful therapeutic and restorative processes to nurture the mind and body. The sound frequency and the vibrations stimulate the brain and the Vagus nerve system so when your body and mind are relaxed, the brain will release happy chemicals (Dopamine, Serotonin, Oxytocin and Endorphins), and higher Vagal tone makes your body better at regulating blood glucose levels, reducing the likelihood of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p>
